data Either a b = Left a | Right b deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show)
So we can use this type to encapsulate a value of one type or another
When we're interested in how some function failed or why, we usually use the result type of Either a b,
where a is some sort of type that can tell us something about the possible failure and b is the type of 
a successful computation.

type Code = String

type LockerMap = Map.Map Int (LockerState, Code)

{-
We're going to make a function that searches for the code in a locker map.
We're going to use an Either String Code type to represent our result.
Our lookup can fail in two ways â€” the locker can be taken, in which case we can't tell the code
or the locker number might not exist at all.

ghci> lockerLookup 100 lockers  
Left "Locker 100 is already taken!"  
ghci> lockerLookup 102 lockers  
Left "Locker number 102 doesn't exist!"

We could have used a Maybe a to represent the result but then we wouldn't know why we couldn't get the code.
