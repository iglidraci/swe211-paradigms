This directory will present several Python features from a functional viewpoint, as follows:
- Pure functions, free of side effects
- Functions as objects that can be passed as arguments or returned as results
- The use of Python strings using object-oriented suffix notation and prefix notation
- Using tuples and named tuples as a way to create stateless objects
- Using iterable collections as our primary design tool for functional programming
